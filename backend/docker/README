Opens ports 2222 (sshd), 5002 (backend results), 6380 (redis) directly on the host.

Basic usage:
make - builds Dockerfile into an image
make run - runs the image as daemon
make sh - gives the container's shell
make del - removes the container

To have full copr stack (including frontend, distgit, and backend), you should first run "vagrant up" in the main project directory.
