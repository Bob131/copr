## Docker Images
Copr-dist-git now builds SRPMs from various sources within containerized environment provided by Docker.
Docker image is built from ./dist_git/docker/Dockerfile and is automatically re-built on `copr-dist-git` service (re)start.

Which means that if you want to modify the Dockerfile, the only thing you need to do is

    systemctl restart copr-dist-git

and then all new SRPM builds will proceed in the modified environment.


However if you want to build the image manually, please run

    docker build ./dist_git/docker/

and then you can use it as desired. For example run shell in it

    docker run -it <image_hash> bash
