- change instance type by build request for more mem/procs/extend timeouts
  - use extra-vars?
  - need ansible 0.9?
- auto-timer/cleanup script for old instances that may have been orphaned
- prune out builders when we drop the number of them active
- LOADS of fixme and catching weird conditions
- make logging from mockremote more sane and coinsistent
- mock configs should be pushed to instances at creation time
  - single url to repos, not mirrorlists
- consider making each worker return job to a completed queue so the primary 
  process can do other kinds of notification
- email notifications from backend?
- refactor mockremote/dispatcher.worker together?
- work on a way to find and cancel a specific build that's happening other than just killing the instance
- determine if it is properly checking the timeout from a dead instance
