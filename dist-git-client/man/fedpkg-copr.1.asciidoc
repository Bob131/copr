DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool enables you to interact with COPR dist-git repository. Except it doesn't
because COPR dist-git repos are currently closed. Currently, this tool only serves 
as srpm "fetch" tool for copr-backend service, so that it can build the srpms.

There are two differences in COPR dist-git when compared to Fedora dist-git:

- COPR repo URLs take form of /<username>/<projectname>/<packagename>.git
- Other than just default branches are supported: mga6, cauldron, and custom
