<h2> Delete Project </h2>
<p>If you really want to delete this Project, you'll have to answer this riddle:</p>
<p>{{ range(5)|random }}.{{ range(10)|random }} hens lay {{ range(5)|random }}.{{ range(10)|random }} eggs in
    {{ range(5)|random }}.{{ range(10)|random }} days. How many eggs do {{ range(5)|random }}.{{ range(10)|random }}
    hens lay in {{ range(5)|random }}.{{ range(10)|random }} days?</p>
<p>Ok, kidding, just type "<strong>yes</strong>" into the below box.</p>
{{ copr_delete_form(form, copr) }}
