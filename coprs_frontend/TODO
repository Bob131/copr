- Unit tests
- Query optimization
- Build details
- Figure out some sane production settings
- More form validations?
- It would be nice to be able to change allowed release arches dynamically by JS while creating/editing coprs
- Convert all remaining forms into wtforms (login, etc)
- Backend API :)
