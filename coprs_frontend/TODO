- Query optimization
- More form validations?
- It would be nice to be able to change allowed release arches dynamically by JS while creating/editing coprs
- Convert all remaining forms into wtforms (login, etc)
- Admin area (making users proven and admins)
- Personal area (changing email)
- Submitting first packages on copr creation
- Sending emails with important info?
- Logging
