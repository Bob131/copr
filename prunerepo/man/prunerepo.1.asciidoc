NAME
----
prunerepo - remove old packages from rpm-md repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
prunerepo [--days DAYS] [--cleancopr] [--nocreaterepo] [--verbose] [-h] [-v] path


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Removes obsoleted package versions from a yum repository. Both
rpms and srpms, that have a newer version available in that same
repository, are deleted from filesystem and rpm-md metadata are 
recreated afterwards. 

Support for specific repository structure (e.g. COPR) is also available
making it possible to additionally remove build logs and whole build 
directories associated with a package. 

After deletion of obsoleted packages, the command
"createrepo_c --database --update" is called 
to recreate the repository metadata.

ARGUMENTS
---------
path::
	local path to a yum repository


OPTIONS
-------
--days DAYS::
	only remove packages older than DAYS (by their build date)

--cleancopr::
	additionaly remove whole copr build dirs and logs if the associated package gets deleted

--nocreaterepo::

	print all deleted items to stdout

-h, --help::

-v, --version::

-h, --help::
	show this help message and exit


EXAMPLES
--------
prunerepo /path/to/repo::
	removes all packages for which a newer version is available in the repository

prunerepo /path/to/repo --cleancopr::
	the same thing but also removes copr-specific build directories if they no longer contain any srpm/rpm package 

prunerepo /path/to/repo --days 7::
	does not delete a package built in last 7 days even if a newer version is available for it

prunerepo /path/to/repo --days 7 --nocreaterepo::
	the same thing but omits call to createrepo_c at the end
