NAME
----
prunerepo - remove old packages from rpm-md repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
prunerepo [--days DAYS] [--cleancopr] [--nocreaterepo] [--verbose] [-h] [-v] path


DESCRIPTION
-----------
RPM packages that have newer version available in that same
repository are deleted from filesystem and the rpm-md metadata are 
recreated afterwards. If there is a source rpm for a deleted rpm
(and they both share the same directory path), then the source rpm 
is deleted as well.

Support for specific repository structure (e.g. COPR) is also available
making it possible to additionally remove build logs and whole build 
directories associated with a package.

After deletion of obsoleted packages, the command
"createrepo_c --database --update" is called 
to recreate the repository metadata.


ARGUMENTS
---------
path::
	local path to a yum repository


OPTIONS
-------
--days DAYS::
	only remove packages older than DAYS (by their build date), does remove srpm only if associated rpm is removed

--cleancopr::
	additionaly remove whole copr build dirs (contain 'build.info' file) and logs if the associated package gets deleted

--nocreaterepo::
	repository is not automatically recreated after deletion

--verbose::
	print all deleted items to stdout

--verbose::
	do not print any info messages, just do your job

-h, --help::
	show this help message and exit

-v, --version::
	print program version and exit


EXAMPLES
--------
prunerepo /path/to/repo::
	removes all packages for which a newer version is available in the repository

prunerepo /path/to/repo --cleancopr::
	the same thing but also removes copr-specific build directories if they no longer contain any srpm/rpm package 

prunerepo /path/to/repo --days 7::
	does not delete a package built in last 7 days even if a newer version is available for it

prunerepo /path/to/repo --days 7 --nocreaterepo::
	the same thing but omits call to createrepo_c at the end
