This is the master copr branch.
Right now all the work is going on in 2 branches:
 - skvidal-backend   - this is the backend/builder code
 - bkabrda-workspace - this is the frontend/webinterface code



Overview of use:
- frontend allows users to create a copr for themselves.
  - then they are able to submit urls to pkgs they wish to build

- the frontend makes the build requests available as JSON

- the backend polls the frontend for new builds
- when it finds a new build it spins off a builder using
  the ansible playbook to create a new builder instance 
  (normally in a private or public cloud)
- it notifies the frontend that the build is starting
- it submits the pkg/repo/etc to be built on the instance with mockchain
- it retrieves the results and saves them into the results dir
- it returns the build status and where to find the results to the front end
